📁 Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

📝 Project Overview

This project focuses on securely hiding sensitive data within digital images using Python and the Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography technique. It ensures data confidentiality without altering the image's visual quality, making hidden data virtually undetectable. 🔐🖼️

🎯 Objectives

🔒 Confidentiality: Conceal data within images without noticeable distortion.

🛡️ Security: Optionally encrypt data before embedding for added protection.

💾 Robustness: Maintain data integrity even after minor image manipulations.

💡 Usability: Provide a simple, user-friendly Python interface.
